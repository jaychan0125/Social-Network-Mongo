## Description 
This week we've been challenged with making a NoSQL database to store user info for a social network platform! NoSQL databases are looser in their rules compared to MySQL databases, so I don't have to have the same things for all of them. However, that did make the joining a little bit more confusing for me... even though I was already struggling with it during the MySQL days. But I've persevered! This database is joined by Users who have Thoughts, these thoughts can also have reactions by different users, and the users can be friend with one another! Sounds fun yeah?!

Heres a [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xUEqTe7dxVCaELIhD9LcVi4XYqvrB31M/view)!

## Installation
You only need express and mongoose to use this! 

## Usage
You'll have to play around with the different endpoints on insomnia to see it in action! I've also included a video walkthorugh if you'd just like to watch that instead of play with it.
